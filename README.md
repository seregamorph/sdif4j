sdif4j is a Simple Dependency Injection Facade for Java
======

This project aims to encapsulate different dependency injection frameworks with own abstraction.
It can be helpful on developing frameworks or any reusable in DI context code.

Currently supported frameworks:
* Google Guice 3.0
* Spring 3.0
* JavaEE CDI 6
* PicoContainer 2.0
* PicoContainer 3.0 [support is in progress, dev/pico branch]

All of these DI frameworks support JSR-330, but in different ways.

You can find examples in sdif4j-testing* subprojects.

This note is incomplete, project in progress.
